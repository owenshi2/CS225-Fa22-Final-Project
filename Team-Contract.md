# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
  Weekly 1-hour meetings conducted via Discord to check on progress and receive assistance. The reason we choose discord is because it gives more room for flexibility for members of the team. Also, Discord is easy to share code or any other kinds of documentation. An extra In-person one hour collaboration will also occur during weekends if the team is falling behind schedule.
2. **Assistance** 
    If teammates need help or need opinions on a certain task, they should directly ping the member in the group channel(in Discord). The target  group member should be able to respond within one work day. Members should be able to decide how they should be able to meet(either online or in person). The assistance should be complete within three days after a group member seeks help. Correspondence with course staff during office hours will be sought out if deemed necessary if all members fail to provide assistance.
3. **Respect**
    In order to ensure an open and safe environment where everyone can express their opinions freely, we firmly believe everyone should take turns during meetings to express opinions on a certain idea or implementation. The rest of the group members should actively listen to the member and ask any remaining questions after the group member finishes. In addition, it would be considered disrespectful to ignore a certain group member’s opinion during a meeting.  If there are disagreements, they should be delivered respectfully and offer actionable points of improvement. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Work will be allocated equally across each team member and if the allocation is deemed to be unequal at a later date, reallocation will occur. We will organize the efforts as follows: for a generic split, three group members should be responsible for developing and testing one of the three algorithms, with the respective responsibilities in algorithms listed below, and the last member is responsible for data cleaning and testing in addition to sending updates to all members of the group. If there are any time conflicts for a group member, other group members are obligated to understand the current progress of the implementation of the algorithm or are to be caught up by the member responsible for sending updates in addition to helping that team member. Team meetings are to be organized and agreed upon by all members of the team, with times decided by majority. 

If an unexpected complication occurs, the team will meet together and discuss the potential ways to resolve the issue. Depending on the availability of each member, the group together will assign work to each group member. For the unforeseen work, the assigned workload for each member does not have to be equal. However, each member should be responsible for completing their assigned tasks and resolve the unexpected issue together as a group.


5. **Time Commitment** 
Each member will be expected to contribute 4 hours of individual work on the project per week, and an additional hour for the weekly meeting. The 4 hours/week is only an estimated average, the actual time commitment per week will vary depending on each group member’s progress, since conditions like seeking assistance and unexpected bugs might add on to the working hours. When new conflicts or commitments inevitably occur,  the group should immediately host a meeting clarifying the conflict. If there is intentional slacking occurring, the group member will be issued a warning. Otherwise, group members directly within the conflict should actively try to resolve the issue by discussing the workload with other group members.  

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Irreconcilable differences in direction will be dealt with by contacting course staff, but members will be expected to truthfully communicate their feelings to the larger group to avoid long-term conflict escalation. 
More specifically, when one member does not accomplish the task/more than fifteen minutes late to the meeting/or any kinds of violations listed by University of Illinois’ code of conduct, he will be issued a warning. Once the member gains three warnings, the group together will report to the course staff about the issue.
