## Summary of Algorithm Full-Scale Run

### Breadth-First Search Traversal

#### Output

After parsing and cleaning the data, we used breadth-first search to populate each city on the graph with infection data...

#### Correctness

As we intended to traverse the graph data set, it was straightforward to see that this algorithm was fully functional when each city connected was populated with external data.
